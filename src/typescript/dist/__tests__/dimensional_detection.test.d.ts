/**
 * DIMENSIONAL DETECTION TESTS
 *
 * These tests verify that the dimensional system correctly detects:
 * 1. V_MODE triggers on existential questions
 * 2. Emergency triggers on somatic distress (not romantic/colloquial)
 * 3. Correct vertical dimension classification
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS EXIST:
 * - "qual è il punto" was not triggering V_MODE (fixed)
 * - Romantic contexts were triggering false emergencies (fixed)
 * - Colloquial expressions were triggering false emergencies (fixed)
 *
 * RUN: npx jest dimensional_detection.test.ts
